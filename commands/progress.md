# /progress — Project Progress

Display the current state of the project, including phase completion, task status, and recent activity.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Load Project State

```bash
# Check if .planning exists
ls .planning/ 2>/dev/null

# Load state
cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null
cat .planning/ROADMAP.md 2>/dev/null
cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null
```

If `.planning/` doesn't exist, inform the user:
> No project state found. Run `/init-project` to initialize project tracking.

### Step 2: Calculate Progress

Parse the state and roadmap to determine:
- Which phase is current
- How many tasks are complete vs. remaining
- What's active right now
- Any blockers

### Step 3: Display Progress Dashboard

```markdown
# 📊 Project Progress: [Name]
