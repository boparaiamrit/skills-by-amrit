# /redesign Workflow Examples

> Full UI/UX redesign audit workflow

## Usage

### Antigravity

```
/redesign
```

### Claude Code

```
@/redesign "the frontend needs a visual overhaul"
```

## Workflow Steps

1. **Backend API Inventory** — maps endpoints and data models
2. **Component Census** — inventories every component, finds duplicates
3. **Design Token Extraction** — extracts all colors, spacing, typography
4. **User Flow Analysis** — walks every flow, marks friction points
5. **Visual Consistency Scoring** — rates uniformity 1-10
6. **Redesign Recommendations** — layered plan (tokens → components → layout → pages → polish)
7. **Implementation Plan** — phased waves with effort estimates
8. **Produce Report** — full audit document with before/after descriptions

## Expected Output

A comprehensive redesign audit with:
- Component census and duplicate detection
- Design token audit (current vs recommended)
- Visual consistency scores by area
- Layered redesign recommendations
- 5-wave implementation plan
